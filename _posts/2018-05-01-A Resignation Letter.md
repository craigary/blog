Since Middle school, I have been always responsible for PowerPoint design for class / team. Especially during my first year in college, nearly half of PowerPoint for my Major were made by me. Also, I made several consults / public trainings during my college life.

An article starting w/ this, doesn’t means l want to show off my past experience, I just want to say I am capable for design a medium-size / large-size PowerPoint, Unfortunately during my recent work, I can’t feel any sense of trust and respect from my clients, I made the first version in an urgent circumstance, I stayed up all night to finish, but in the weekend, the script which I followed to make slides were changed, the I need to do over again. The first edition were nearly 50 slides, which remains less than 10.

And in the demand of my clients, I “deteriorated” my slides, almost every fine changes doesn’t follow the design principles, its idealized, In the end, it turns into “Let me tell you where you need to put the elements, you must listen to me, you only know how to make slides beautiful, But I know how to make judges impressed.” … The final outcome can’t make myself satisfied and totally not what I was expect in the beginning. The whole slide production is a result of continuous forced compromise.

I don’t what my clients think I am a bad tempered, bigheaded. Because surely I am not. So I kept following their demands. But everyone has a boundary that we can’t cross, no matter in a designing aspect or being a man. so far beyond the bottom line that I can accept, I am no longer responsible for the PowerPoint design and further process.

Making PowerPoint nearly a decade, I hardly see someone ask me to make big changes, when someone or a team contact me for design, usually they give me a full trust. Even when they have their own ideas, we will discuss. I never meet someone like this, trying to make me abandon my ideas, and follow their thoughts completely. It’s so ironic that a 220 pound man ask a fitness coach to follow this rules to keep fit.

I want to say thank you to my consular, whom I helped to make a lot of presentations during this 3 years in college, we will talk and discuss when she comes up her own idea, usually I won, but during the whole process, I can feel the respect to me, and to the design.

Most of PowerPoint I make these years are pro bono. I meal / iced Americano / playing cute are enough. But free doesn’t means “low quality”, I wish more people could respect the design. Every slides I made costs the heart blood. When I delete nearly 40 slides, my heart were blood dropping. When I “deteriorated “rest of my slides, I feel like stirred the salad, I wish that in a country with the least respect for design, More and more people are in awe of design.

 “In the coming days / to whom abandoned me, I wish you could always believe / that your choices were correct. “ This is for me, and for you. I wish y’all all the best.

P.S I’ve been on the stage for years and never been a pussy, what I am capable are more than just design ^_^
